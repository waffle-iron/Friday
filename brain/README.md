# Aiden

Aiden is a RiveScript chatbot personality. It's also an initiative to replace
the "standard brain" that ships with all of the RiveScript modules with a newer,
updated set of replies.

This repository only contains the RiveScript source files (`*.rive`). You'll
require a RiveScript application, such as those that ship with the interpreter
modules, to run this chatbot personality. There are many implementations of
RiveScript, including complete chatbots (that connect to Slack or XMPP, etc.)
on the AiChaos GitHub organization: <https://github.com/aichaos>.

# Naming Convention

* Files beginning with `std-` are candidates for being included in the standard
  brain shipped with RiveScript implementations.
* Files beginning with `data-` are larger data sets (usually in array form),
  such as a listing of common first names.
